			      <h2> Shonda's works </h2>
			         <p class="author"><em><strong>By Maíra Araújo</strong></em></p>

			       <p>As you might have noticed, I am here to talk about Shonda Rhimes’s best works in my opinion. <br>
					Both Grey’s Anatomy and How to get away with murder are extremely gripping series. They are loaded with drama and the 
					thing I think I like the most is that we can find all kind of people represented in them. As an LGBTQI+ person, I like to 
					see this kind of representation in series as it looks more like real life for me. </p>
					
					<p class="aboutGreys">
						Grey’s Anatomy is a medical series, almost 90% based in hospitals and the other 10% is the life of the doctors out of 
					   it. There is a lot of drama, a lot of deaths (important deaths) that make me feel like I know the person who is dying.
					   It is absolutely engaging. <br>
					   For Rhimes to write something so specific about one kind of profession, she might have to study and understand a lot of 
					   things about this profession, as in the series we can find loads of diagnosis, surgeries, symptoms, etc.</p>
					
					<p class="abouthow">
						How to get away with murder, is not as dramatic as Grey’s Anatomy but still, there is a lot of drama. For me this series 
					   is more about mystery, about hiding your flaws. <br>
					   This series is about a famous and powerful lawyer that teaches in a University and some recruited students. After being 
					   recruited by her, all their lives change a lot as they commit crimes, try to hide it, find out a lot about the life of their 
					   teacher and sometimes they even go crazy. There are lies, love, fake love, tears and, specially, the rise of flaws in 
					   apparently flawless people, just like real life.
