			      <h2> Who is Shonda Rhimes </h2>

			         <p>Shonda Rhimes is an American television writer, producer and director. She was born in January 13 1970, in Chicago, 
						 Illinois, U.S. <a href="https://www.biography.com/media-figure/shonda-rhimes">(Editors, 2020)</a>. After graduating from Dartmouth
						 in 1991 she attended a film school at the University of Southern California. The thing is she always dreamed of becoming a novelist
						 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shonda-Rhimes">(Tikkanen, 2021)</a>. She wrote some movies in her path until she turned
						 her focus to TV series. 
					 </p>
					<p>According to <a href="https://www.biography.com/media-figure/shonda-rhimes">(Editors, 2020)</a>, Rhimes adopted a baby girl in 2001 and 
					   during her staying at home with the new child she had the inspiration to write one of my favourites (if not THE one) series: Greys 
					   Anatomy. Debuted in 2005, Greys Anatomy is a TV series about the life of young doctors in a hospital. The mentioned writer says that 
					   Rhimes enjoy watching real-life surgeries. The series had so much success that is still starring, currently in its 17th season. It has
					   won some prizes of best television series. Not stopping with that, Shonda Rhimes continued writing some other tv series, like Scandal 
					   (a political series) and How to get away with murder, debuting in 2014 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shonda-Rhimes">(Tikkanen, 2021)</a>.
					   Another of my favourites tv series. 
					</p>
					<p>
						How to get away with murder is about some students critically chosen by a very famous and powerful lawyer that is also their teacher. 
						Their lives turn up to become a real mess while they commit a lot of crimes and try to hide it.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have never watched any of those series, you probably read everything until here not thinking that in them there are a lot of 
						representation. Shonda Rhimes is known by her representing characters. She always includes black people, women, LGBTQI+, in powerful 
						roles. With Scandal, she <em>“marked the first time in some four decades that a network drama featured an African American woman in the 
						lead role.”</em> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shonda-Rhimes">(Tikkanen, 2021)</a>. Rhimes is also <em>“the first African
						American woman to create and executive produce a Top 10 network series — the medical drama Grey's Anatomy.”</em> <a href="https://www.biography.com/media-figure/shonda-rhimes">(Editors, 2020)</a>

							Power is not power if you do not know you have it. I've seen plenty of powerful women squander a chance at power simply because they 
							waited for someone else to give them permission to have power. <br>
